churn_model
==============================

## ML churn prediction model MLOps project
Entire machine learning lifecycle with the MLOps tools.

A simple ML churn  model trained using using open-source tools. Experiments, API and front-end deployment are done using Flask, GitHub actions, and Heroku. Finally, production model monitoring is done using EvidentlyAI.

The model is build using Kaggle  [churn data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020/data?select=train.csv).


## App API and front end display
The resulting app is displayed allowing to get churn predictions from given introduced values as showin in the image below.
