churn_model
==============================

## ML churn prediction model MLOps project
Entire machine learning lifecycle with the MLOps tools.

A simple ML churn  model trained using using open-source tools. Experiments, API and front-end deployment are done using Flask, GitHub actions, and Heroku. Finally, production model monitoring is done using EvidentlyAI.

The model is build using Kaggle  [churn data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020/data?select=train.csv) subset.
#### Data fields
* number_vmail_messages, numerical. Number of voice-mail messages.
* total_day_calls, numerical. Total number of day calls.
* total_eve_minutes, numerical. Total minutes of evening calls.
* total_eve_charge, numerical. Total charge of evening calls.
* total_intl_minutes, numerical. Total minutes of international calls.
* number_customer_service_calls, numerical. Number of calls to customer service


## Pipeline Creation using DVC
To manage the pipeline we use [DVC](https://dvc.org/)  which, together with Git,  allows to  code and data versioning for reproducibility.

An advantage of using DVC is that it only executes the stage only if any of it's dependencies (data, code or parametres) are changed.

## Experiment cicle with MLFlow
Store and manage experiments, i.e. model paramenter and hyper parameter variations, using  [MlFlow](https://mlflow.org/). This tool allows to store and compare all experiment settings in order to compare them and promote the  best performing model to production.

First we launch the server.

Then we can access the experiments dashboard and its contents.

## Unit Tests
Set unit tests with Pytest.

## Monitor model using EvidentlyAI
Evidently  allows to compare new available data with the data used to train  the model. We can generate Dashbords or json outputs to inspect if if the distribution of any of the new data training features has significantly changed (concept drifft) or if there is a model performance decay (model drift).  Eventually, a shell script could be enabled to automatically retrain the model if there is a detected drift.

## App API and front end display with Flask
A simple web application has been created using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) web framework to consume the created model publishing an end point to present the user interface. The resulting app front-end is displayed allowing to get churn predictions from given introduced values as shown in the image below (click to enlarge).
